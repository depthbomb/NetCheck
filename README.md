# NetCheck

_NetCheck_ is a simple internet connectivity monitoring application for Windows 10+. I've been using a personal version of NetCheck for over a year now but lost the source code when I had reinstalled Windows, so I decided to recreate the project with additional features and improvements.

Compared to the original project, this version includes an average latency display, network type display, and optional notifying of internet issues (planned feature).

## Requirements
